I came in with my family (Mom and Dad) and they said 10 minute wait, we said okay, we notice that they were short with their staff so we waited patiently till we were seated at a table, but that 10 minutes turned into a 30min wait. So the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait, after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn\\'t exist, the hostess later seated another table which were 4 Caucasian customers, we were still patiently waited for around another 30min, when those 4 sat down an Asian waiter quickly came to take their order, I got the waiters attention and said excuse me, we came here first. And she made up an excuse saying how \"Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy\" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say \"Oh but they serve the people who come before\" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table\" she said it depends. So in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well, called Rice Paper.',\n",

Today's daily specials were steak and eggs and jalapeño hash thingy. They just ran out of steaks I was told. Made the decision easier. I got jalapeño hash thingy. The food was OK.

       "  'text': \"Nestled in what is (for now) a relatively sleepy corner of Downtown, Urban Bodega (aka URBO) feels like something of a throwback to some of the small convenience stores I used to see line the Roosevelt Row neighborhood.  Back when Downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread, you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer, to snacks, to cooking essentials, and even a few household cleaning items.  The relatively new Pure Fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th Avenue in Downtown.  But for now, the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car.  All the more reason URBO's location makes sense.\\n\\nYou'll find URBO on the bottom floor of the Pure Fillmore Apartments on Fillmore Street just east of 7th Avenue.  The brainchild of DeSoto Central Market alum Shawn Connelly, you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way).  Inside, its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space.  Behind the counter, you can get coffee, tea, or even a sandwich made on the spot.  In front of the counter, it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect.  Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags.  I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here.\\n\\nFor my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up.  A tea and a sandwich.  I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin.  Both made to order.  Total cost including tax: $10.  Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here.  Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty.  I was also very happy with the tea.  Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents.  A solid breakfast.\\n\\nSo there you have it.  A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood.  Nothing pretentious.  Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store.  Even if you don't live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.  Or a sip and bite and it was in my case.\",\n",

I do believe this place needs to have nicer decorations and designs and maybe better location cause the food is so good, more people are going to come! I do want one like this in flagstaff as well! Haha hopefully the business owner can read this and expand their business cause for sure it'll be the biggest hit in northern AZ. Loved my experience here. Price is very affordable as well!

       "  'text': 'I am an Ubereats delivery driver.  I arrived at the restaurant at 2:48 pm and stood at the courier pickup counter.  There was a young lady running the register, and a manager with headset delegating tasks to the staff visible from my view point.  The manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  At no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  After 8 minutes of standing there, I finally locked on and said HEY, is the ubereats order ready yet?  \\n\\nHis response to me was \"You should have spoken up, I can\\'t read your mind\".  This response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction I have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  This man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  This is whom they are taking their cues from.  \\n\\nSo, I will speak up.  Greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  And customer service is the business you are in, Mr. Manager.  Your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you\\'ve closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  Don\\'t you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  I have the answer, and the answer is yes.  \\n\\nI will never again do a food delivery at this location.  I can guarantee you I am not the only one, because often times I am pinged from 10 miles away from this restaurant to do a delivery.  Really?  There\\'s nobody within 10 miles if this place that is willing to go there?  There is a reason!  Corporate needs to take a look at this franchise and consider revoking the license.  Read these yelp reviews very carefully.',\n",

I was skeptical, but now impressed. The enchiladas are, I mean, REALLY good. I had one of each kind of tortilla, beef, with red & green sauce and both kinds of cheese. I had them sprinkle some cotija on top with just a taste of the jalapeno ranch sauce. It was perfect! I got chips and salsa on the side as well as the Honey V slaw. The slaw is really good, wish they served it in a bigger dish. The salsas were also good. BUT, the chips were nasty. They tasted like they were cooked in rancid oil. Not sure if it's just the kind of oil they use or if they in fact used old oil to make them. So I dont recommend the chips. But don't be like me and judge it before you try it. It's definitely worth your time. Yum!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"So I finally tried the covenant for happy hour. This is an interesting location that at one time was a shoe store and also a vitamin store. You would never know it when you walk in today.\\n\\nIt's a bit of a trendy bar and restaurant. But there's a little bit more substance than just sizzle. They are very much into using local supplies from farmers and other artisan purveyors. Maybe they take it a step too far, in the fact that of the beer that they have on tap, half of them are from OHSO, which has a location in the next parking lot. I would've liked to see other wonderful local beer choices. (If I wanted OHSO's beer, I would've gone there, just saying). \\n\\nIt's got a wonderful open feeling in the restaurant. The kitchen is totally viewable from the bar. And you can see all of the bustling activity going on. The bar is also uniquely set up with a hundred bottles of alcohol attractively displayed. As you move toward the back of the restaurant they have a very large wine storage glass locker that goes from floor to ceiling Maybe 16 or 18 feet tall.\\n\\nThe crabcake is very attractively served on a bed of arugula and unlike others it is not filled with crackers. I liked the charred octopus but would not preferred that come with roasted potatoes. They have a nice charcuterie board as well as a hummus board. And a goat cheese bruschetta and I know the goat cheese comes from my friend Wendell Crow's Dairy. \\n\\nI did not try any of the entrées since I was there for happy hour. That will be for another day.\",\n",

However, Bianco manages the high volume pretty well. Our party five arrived right at opening hours and were seated inside within  15 minutes. Had we opted for outside, it could've been even sooner.\\n\\nExperiencing trendy pizza with parents can be questionable. They don't always understand why ingredients beyond pepperoni are added. Mine threw caution to the wind and let my husband and i order for the table. Not surprisingly, they loved the Margherita pizza the best. I liked the signature white pie crust. My husband loved it all.\\n\\nIt's upscale casual, like a lot of places in Scottsdale. Guests were on dates, with their kids, or like us in a mid-sized group. Service was hip but not snotty. It's pretty much my dream pizza joint.\",\n",

So as she proceeded to go on with ordering the three meat deal that y\\'all had which consisted of the ribs smoked sausage and Crispers. When she was done she proceeded to tell me to go ahead and order and our rude waitress decides to stop us  right there and tell us very loudly  that \"that was a lot of food\" she proceeded to tell us \"she\\'ll give us what ever we want\" but, \"I\\'m just saying that\\'s a lot of food\" how embarrassing is it for your server to make you feel embarrassed about what you want to order. We decided to get up and leave right at that moment we offered to pay our bill and spoke with the manager and he told us not even to worry about our bill and just to go ahead and walk out and then he apologized for what had happened. I will never step foot in that Chili\\'s again. I have never felt so humiliated in my entire life time and I was at that very moment.',\n",

I can also say that depending on the time that you go the food can be terrible. This place has sort of become a gamble to go to. However, I still love their Jade Red Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice. Their refried beans are good as well and so are their quesadillas (quesadilla with Jerk or Jade Red chicken). Not everything on the menu is good, especially for me who loves seasoning. I would recommend to stay away from the Gringo Chicken and Emerald Chicken. I would recommend to try the Pollo Diablo or the Chinese Barbecue Pork on top of the Jade Red. Teriyaki chicken is not true Teriyaki (as is most American 'Teriyaki') as it is cut up unseasoned breast meat with sauce poured on top. Overall, for the items that I like solely, this place is four stars. Also, the snickerdoodle cookies are to die for, especially when they come out fresh and warm!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I received a random follow request on IG from Taco & Dilla Parlor and that\\'s really the reason we decided to check them out.\\n\\nLOCATION:\\nRight out of the gate the location is a bit tough to work with, parking is scarce and if you\\'re not a fan of strip malls then you\\'ll probably want to steer clear. Getting past that, inside is a lot bigger than I was expecting, there\\'s plenty of room to sit and the decide is what you might expect from an urban, Mexican spot. Luchador paintings mixed with some religious imagery\\n\\nFOOD:\\nin order to be sure we could provide a fair & balanced review, we waited to make sure the sample size was adequate. We ordered\\n\\n*Tacos- 2 pollo, 2 carnitas, 2 shrimp 2 asada\\n*Dillas- Mac Daddy ( Mac & Cheese w/ Chorizo)\\n*Chips & Guac\\n*Mango Madness & a Lemonade\\n\\nHere\\'s the breakdown: Pollo tacos were a little bland. The serving was very generous but the seasoning seemed to be lacking. Carnitas were along the same lines, and little on the dry side. Still, a good crisp to them and with salt and lime, they were not bad. Shrimp was good, especially if you get some with a lite char to them. Carne Asada were by far the best tacos (which is huge) as the staple of tacos, it was important to get these right and they did a great job. Juicy and tender meat, good seasoning and just enough char. When it comes to the best thing we ordered; Mac Daddy Dilla takes the crown! This unique take on a quesadilla was packed with flavor, the Mac was cooked just right, the Chorizo was spicy and moist, the jack cheese added another layer of salt and spice that tied everything together. They do offer Dillas with all of the taco meats so if you\\'re one that appreciates flavorful cuisine (like me) I would say that\\'s the way to go.\\n\\nVERDICT:\\nTaco & Dilla Parlor seems to be very much in a growing phase and like any new business it\\'s experiencing some growing pains. However, there also seems to be a lot of potential here and with a few solid items on the menu I would definitely recommend giving them a try. I will confess that there is a lot of \"negative\" remarks in this review, but I wanted to be sure that I highlighted the positives so I\\'m giving them 4 stars because I really think they have the ability be great.',\n",

As for the spicy pork; my friend said he couldn't taste anything except spice and boy was he sweating.  \\n\\nIn the end, I think I'll pass on this place, but what really made me pass is both my friends didn't feel too well after their visit.  Service was good overall, but we were the only guest.  Again, was it an off day or was it business as usual?  I don't know but I generally hate giving 1 stars to a place that tries, however I have to be honest for my readers. - Enjoy!\",\n",

The food is a unique blend of Chinese, Mexican, and Jamaican cuisines. My favorite combination is the Jade Red Chicken, the Pollo Diablo with Black Beans and Jerk Fried Rice (That's 7 & 13 BLK JFR on the menu)! You can't beat the sweetness and perfectly fried taste of the Jade Red Chicken. The Pollo Diablo is a deliciously spicy and tangy combination of garlic, green onion, peppers, and spices with the most aromatic and crispy cornstarch fried chicken gems. The black beans are the best I have ever had, and they are perfectly smoothed out, accompanied by some gooey melted cheese on top! Do not leave without getting some of their amazing hot sauce! It pairs very well with the Pollo Diablo. Every meal gets a free cookie, the soft and chewy snickerdoodles are definitely our favorite! Eat in or take out, the quality is always good!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'There are times I have an urge to give a place a terrible rating just so I can keep it my little secret. Of course I would never actually do that, my greater desire is to see them succeed and prosper so I have them to go to for a long time to come.\\n\\nFuego Taco Shop one cold wintery Friday afternoon immediately became a new neighborhood favorite for me. It is tiny and located in a run-down strip mall amidst a lot of automotive repair places and fast food joints and they are easy to overlook as you drive by.\\n\\nBut inside they are clean and warmly friendly and their unique but limited menu is a far cry from all the other me-to Mexican restaurants nearby. I fully get it that some people who are used to Taco Bell won\\'t understand that certain types of meat that are authentic to other cultures may be too foreign for them and the use of a mesquite barbecue grill at a taco shop may taste \"weird\" if fast food is all you\\'ve ever known, but if you\\'ve traveled extensively your opinion may be totally opposite.\\n\\nAt first glance the prices seem a bit high but once you see the quantity and quality of the food there is no quibble with how much they charge. \\n\\nWe both had the Fuego tacos combo at about $10 each. Their fountain drinks are reasonably priced at 75 cents and $1.25 with the smaller one being considered a large at most fast food places, and here they don\\'t taste as watered down.\\n\\nThe al pastor soft tacos are generously filled with tender tasty kabob-like meat with a hearty mesquite charcoal flavor. We choose to have it topped with pico de gallo which nicely complimented the meat. The three tacos were accompanied by a lightly spiced Spanish rice and tangy refritos and we opted for a hotter than average salsa to add some additional fuego.\\n\\nI love this place and would not change a thing. Well, okay I would make one tiny almost insignificant suggestion ... please switch to slightly larger plastic forks, if you shop at Costco you might find them at the same price as those you\\'re buying now, but the current ones are just too tiny to eat rice and beans with.

Order was quick and fries were hot so I started at 5 stars with that because that doesn\\'t typically happen with fast food restaurants. Got into the car to travel to our somewhat distant destination and was too hungry to wait so we pulled out our sandwiches- oh hey! Look! They forgot my cheddar. Surprise surprise. Whatever, I got over it. I get an idea thinking, they only screwed up once and didn\\'t forget my friends marinara. Nope, squash that. So much for that. Two stars down, I decided hey, you know what. We have to drive back this way after the couple hours we\\'re out here for so maybe they\\'ll fix this and refund the cheddar so I call. After about 15 rings a woman answers it and says \"hold on a second\" while I get placed on hold. About a minute later my phone gets that sweet click where they hang up on you.

It's a small menu, which I appreciate. They do a small number of things, and they do them well. Tacos are all excellent (there's even a vegetarian option- calabacitas), the gorditas are delicious (choice of red or green sauce. The red is divine), but for me, the Pastor Burrito was life changing. Perfect blend of flavorful and spicy, the flour tortilla holds up to the filling but still melts in your mouth, and it's large enough for a meal. Sooooo good! I even catered a party for 40 people with them recently. There is no specific catering menu- I simply ordered a metric ton of tacos & quesadillas, gave them a few days notice, and paid in advance. The service was wonderful, and guests raved about the food. Not a single taco was spared. If you're looking for a hole in the wall gem, this is it.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I was between appointments at the Mayo clinic and looking for a quick place to grab lunch; thank goodness for Yelp because this place is such a great find! You walk in to the intoxicating smell and sizzle of grilled meat, and there is a huge open mesquite grill just inside the entrance. There's something to be said about doing one thing and doing it well - the grilled steak and chicken are definitely the stars of the show. The menu is similar to Chipotle as you pick your protein and can have it one of four ways - in a taco, burrito, quesadilla, or protein bowl. As it was Taco Tuesday, I had a chicken and a steak taco for $2 each. I added a side of rice and beans and a fountain drink and the entire tab was less than $10. And you get a TON of food. The tacos themselves are pretty basic - flour or corn tortilla, choice of meat, cheese, guac But you can head over to their condiment bar and really load them up! The pico de gallo is super fresh and tasty. Top it off with a squeeze of fresh lime and their amaaaazing green sauce and you have a feast! They also have cabbage and onions for those who are inclined. Both meats were incredible flavorful and tender, though I was partial to the steak. The rice and beans were pretty standard fare - solid, but nothing to write home about. Same goes for the mango drink and horchata. Service is quick and friendly. Next time I'd probably skip them and add another taco! I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area!\",\n",

I'm a big boy and 3 of these things loaded up and I'm ready for a nap. Quality is very good on the ingredients and I love being able to customize my enchilada.

Extremely slow service every single time. Today, there were two people working. They were very clearly frustrated at how busy it was and how understaffed they were. I heard one of the employees complaining about how he was going to be late for work and saw him throw his cell phone down in frustration. He rushed to make my drink, which I waited for about 15 minutes to receive, and he added way too much ice so it tastes terrible. I would have asked him to fix it, but there were 10 people in line and five other people waiting for their orders.  They are opening one in North West Peoria in my neighborhood, and I hope they get that one right.\",\n",

We decided to splurge on a bottle of wine and selected the Char Sui Pork Belly Steamed Buns as an appetizer. They were very good and the only complaint we had was the sauce served on them was inconsistent in its quantity. The first had very little (too sparse) while the middle one seemed perfect and then the third one seemed to have just a tad too much so it was a bit overpowering. But the pork belly was cooked perfectly and had a very nice crispiness on the outside of it. Our entrees arrived and I opted for the Classic Four (Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Misoyaki Butterfish, Blackened Ahi Tuna, and Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi). They were all fabulous with my favorites being the Butterfish and the Salmon and my least favorite the Mahi Mahi - which totally surprised me as I was expecting it to be my favorite. It just seemed to lack the flavor the others had and seemed a little too mushy. Hubby ordered the Shellfish Sampler which consisted of Lobster Tail, Seared Sea Scallops, Teppanyaki Shrimp, and Asparagus. His also came with a Lobster Red Curry Sauce and Creamy Jasmine Rice. He loved his as well and although a couple of the shrimps seemed to be a tad over cooked, they were still delicious! We also got sides of the Asparagus with Beurre Blanc and the Lump Crab Fried Rice. The Asparagus was amazing and cooked perfectly! Hubby couldn't quit raving about them! The Fried Rice was okay but nothing spectacular honestly. Service was great and our waitress was very attentive and brought us a free Chocolate Molten Lava Soufflé with ice cream for our anniversary. Very much appreciated and ooey, gooey deliciousness! All in all a very good meal and one that I will remember and can't wait to\",\n",

We were not welcomed but, again, it was the end of the night and the busser was cleaning the tables and finishing up. The girl who waited on us was friendly and helped us choose food off the menu. (The menu is not particularly cohesive in its choices. No real theme.) We decided on the California Burger and added mushrooms. We are not \"fries\" people so we ordered the red potatoes. The food came out fairly quickly but we had to scrounge for silverware and a napkin to no avail until she returned to a different table and we called out. The raspberry lemonade and food was really good. I considered going back in the morning for some bacon, eggs and more potatoes, but maybe next time. (We checked out of the Hyatt early cause the fire alarm went off on the 21st floor and stopped all the elevators. We decided to just get out of Dodge.) We didn\\'t go inside so not sure how clean the bathrooms are but the outdoor patio was clean enough and the food was good. I\\'d go back for lunch.',\n",

I got the cooked meat sampler no chicken. All meat is claimed to be pecan smoked. I tasted no smoke let alone pecan. I'll start with the chopped pork it was under cooked, tough and no flavor. Ribs not tough but boiled first then cooked. If you like boiled ribs this place is for you. I also had what they called brisket. When the guy pulled the brisket from below and I saw the size of it. There is no way that could be brisket from a cow. I have never seen a brisket that big. I have smoked and seen a lot of them. My guess is it was beef shoulder clod. Which can be good if cooked right. But this mess! It was beyond tough, but had some juice to it. It was under cooked and a pretty good sized piece of fat cap connected to it. I don't know where else in Phoenix they may have one of these places but where ever it is I will avoid it like the plague. They should change the name to Joe's real nasty bbq(cooked meat).

However, a restaurant like this shouldn\\'t require reservations, but in order to get your food in a timely manner that\\'s almost what it needs.\\n\\nI\\'m not too sure what the issue is because I\\'ve seen busier restaurants and I\\'ve never had to wait so long! I\\'ve complained before regarding the long wait and they told me if I want to be able to get my food in a timely manner, then I should call my food in ahead of time. Well I\\'ve tried THREE TIMES! \\n\\nOn one occasion they put me on hold for ten minutes, which I wasn\\'t upset about. Then someone picked up the phone and said \"oh someone\\'s on a call\" and they were scrounging around to find out who\\'s on call with me until the finally said hello AND ended up hanging up on me. Second time I tried calling, they said they couldn\\'t hear me and hung up on me and when I tried calling back, it was busy for 30 minutes. Third time (which is the last time I tried calling) no one ever picked up. Either I was getting hung up on MULTIPLE times or they were ignoring my calls, which I tried calling from didn\\'t numbers thinking it might have been my service.\\n\\nAt some point the poor service starts to outweigh the food.

We chose to sit next to the fire pit which kept us comfortable if not a bit too warm!  The important thing is that I never felt like I was right off of busy 7th street.  The music and patio design were effective in keeping the traffic noise at bay.\\n\\nAs for the food, the Liver Pate is one of the most memorable appetizers I've had in a long time.  Served with house pickles, grain mustard and blackberry jam, it's stands on it's own but becomes a whole new experience when you combine these flavors.  Would come back just for this plate and a beer.\\n\\nMy friend had the Milanesa sandwich and I opted for the Ahi Tuna.  No complaints about the food--it would qualify as good but not great, meaning that it wouldn't prevent me from recommending Joe's, but at the same time it's pretty standard sandwich fare.  A mix up in the kitchen meant our entrees were brought out before we had finished the liver pate, so that may have something to do with the overall impression.  \\n\\nThe service was good from start to finish--and this includes all the staff. The hostess was friendly, the manager at the door was attentive, and the man busing the table was polite and never intrusive.  Our server was jovial, prompt and knowledgeable. \\n\\nOverall a pleasant experience and a nice night out.\",\n",

The first time was nearly 3 and a half ours for a chicken sand which, a medium pizza and a salad. Come to find out the only two working is the manager and the delivery driver. I don't blame them for it but this is ridiculous.  The only reason I'm getting dominos delivered is because they're the only place I can get a salad without paying $5.99 for a delivery fee. I'm waiting for the food I ordered at 7:32 and it's already 8:52. No food yet. They need to seriously hire some new people. Running the bare minimum for a delivery pizza place isn't smart especially doing it at night. I've also called multiple times to no one answering the phone or I would get hung up on by the automated service.\\n\\nUPDATE: I never received the salad I paid for and no one is answering the phone. I've called over 10 times.\",\n",

Because they have a simple menu, they are able to concentrate on the high quality of product. The ribs were tender and fall-off-the-bone, the brisket and pulled pork where outstanding, and even had those beautiful smoke rings. The BBQ sauces are kept warm, nice touch!! They even offered pieces of their chocolate chip cookies sprinkled with a little bit of salt!! The only thing that could have been better was the corn muffins. They were flavorful, just a tad bit on the dry side. I cannot wait to come back and try more, I'm already looking forward to my next visit, and thank you to everyone there for the amazing service!!\",\n",

Another 5 minutes passed before they came over. Ordered drinks which took a while. Then ordered food which took over 40 minutes.

This place is absolutely fantastic and honestly the most consistent restaurant I've been to in the valley. The menu is inventive but not gratuitously so, the service is amazing every single time no matter who is bartending/serving, and the prices are fair. I love that they have valet, so parking is never an issue. The decor and atmosphere is very well-done. Definitely one of my favourite spots to visit.\",\n",

During this time my server was at a table on her cell phone hanging out with other employees... An employee was dancing on my server while I continued to wait for the bbq sauce. \\n\\nI had to get up and go to the table of employees to ask for me check. The server replied that she was now off and I had a new server because she was in a \" social media meeting \"  unfortunately I never was introduced to this new server and they never checked on my table.

After the 2nd mimosa, I asked for one without orange juice because the citrus was getting to me. I was informed the pour would be smaller then. 1st of all the flutes are already only filled halfway, what? And when you do not get OJ, you are looking at a shot of cheap sparking wine. WOW!

Our bartender offered tastes of the wines we were interested in and made food recommendations. I chose the single American Burger, which is the best burger in town by far. My wife chose the Lobster Roll- which came out perfect.  A guy next to us had bought a bottle of an ice wine, and was kind enough to share a taste with us. The vibe continued when we ordered dessert - the Coconut Cream Pie is heaven. No better word describes it. But the best part of our day was the service - both bartenders were very helpful and worked together to make us feel like regulars - which we plan on doing. Thanks!\",\n",

In fact I was in the store on 3/23 and purchased a dozen and asked if there was an issue if I came in and purchased 3 dozen and I was told no.  Now 3/24 I stop by to purchase 3 dozen and I am told that anything over 2 dozen needs to be requested at least 2 days in advance.  I am a business major and I understand having product on hand so that your case is not empty but I would never turn a customer away or even make it seem as if it were an issue because my product is being purchased instead of being thrown out.  I was told that this time I could purchase 3 dozen but for future I would have to place an order.  This isn't the type of customer service I enjoy and I can take my purchases else where this isn't the only place that sells French macarons.  I believe you need to re-evaluate what the purpose of your company is, are you wanting to make a profit or be left with inventory? Not to mention the lack of customer service, you may want to let all your staff know that any large orders need to have at least 48 hour notice because it doesn't seem to be common knowledge.\",\n",

As I\\'ve heard the management has recently changed.  While improvements have been made they have not been service or food focused.  The huge tv on the side wall composed of 9 large TVs is a great addition, unfortunately I did not discover them until I went to the restroom just before leaving because it\\'s hidden back in a corner.

Ok to charge for the cold fries replaced, but twice??\\nDidn\\'t realize until we left. Nothing to do because we had to leave. Maybe should have warmed fries between my hands instead of asking for new order. \\nBLT was ok, Fries cold but ketchup great, overcharged, crowded but fun.  Maybe that is what is \"in\". I won\\'t be back. Tarbell should do better',\n",

I think they have this promotion throughout other days of the week but I cannot remember... sorry!\\n\\nThe tacos were good with the promotion, but I wouldn't want to pay more as the taste is not that great. The drinks are strong, I'll give them that. We also had Guacamole for the table with chips and that was alright. \\n\\nI checked in on yelp and was presented with a discount. When the check was dropped I showed it to our server and she said she had never seen it before and had to consult her manager.

Another party came by and they ordered drinks and food right away once they sat down AND got their food way before we did. I understand that in the menu, it states that there will be a little wait since it's just the cook and an assistant but damn, we waited over an hour to just get our food. And they got better service once they sat down than we did. I ordered the carnitas and my mom and Brother got the chimichanga. Let me tell you about my carnitas. Or should I say, Manteca (fat). Where's the meat? It was hiding. I literally had to dig inside the fat and cheese  to find it! The beans, were ok. Just boiled regular pinto beans with no salt and added cheese. The rice was actually ok but I was so disgusted to eat anything. My brother and mom liked the chimichanga but skipped the rice and beans. In the meantime that I was trying to find my carnitas in the Manteca, no one. But I mean NO ONE checked on us to see if we needed anything else or to see how the food was. The waiter didn't even ask if my food was ok since I left the whole plate when we asked for the check. He just bypassed it like it was normal. What a disappointment.

If I didn't know I was eating Vegan, I would not have known I was eating Vegan.  That is seriously how good the food is here.  \\nShared the Vegan Queen Margherita Pizza and just WOW! The cheese they use was incredible.  The tomatoes were so flavorfully sweet and fresh and had the most beautiful bright red color.  Tomatoes just don't taste like this but they actually take the time to marinate them before adding them to this pizza.  Who does that?  Thankfully, they do!  Plus, OMG, they even add an abundant amount of (chiffonade) fresh basil and it was amazing!!! It looked and tasted beautiful!  The crust was as good as it gets also.  It is obviously, homemade and stretched.  The crust made this pizza spectacular!\\nThe Vegan Ziti with Soy Sausage was another dish that you would not know is Vegan. This is a spicy dish so if you like spice, this is a must try. I literally thought they gave us the regular and not the Vegan.  That is how good it was.  They individually make the pasta so not premade and scooped out onto a plate.  It is freshly baked and worth the extra wait to get freshly made food here.  \\nThe Vegan Veggie Balls are another must try! They are definitely fresh made here!  You can look at them and taste that they are.  You can choose from 3 sauces and we chose the buffalo and loved it! If you don't like spice, they have a vegan ranch option or marinara.  \\nThis is not the place to bring your screaming hungry kids because they take the time to prepare the freshest tastiest food from scratch so it takes time for that.  This is not slow service.  Don't confuse it with that.  Just like it takes time to cook a good meal at home, it takes that same amount of time here.  So just sit back and relax and enjoy your company while you wait and enjoy your meal when ever it arrives.\",\n",

My family had visited Oregano's before, so they ordered a pepperoni pizza, O'riba pizza, Chipotle Chicken pasta, Spaghetti and Meatballs, Garlic bread, and Calamari. The calamari came out first and it was so crunchy and delicious with the marinara sauce. Next came the garlic bread, and then the pizzas and pastas were brought out. The pizzas were delicious! I enjoyed the thin crust, especially the crunchiness at the end. The pastas were great with cheese, served hot, and both sauces were incredible! I also liked that the Chipotle Chicken pasta came with garlic bread. The service was also amazing. Overall, delicious restaurant, and I will definitely be returning!\",\n",

My friend and I woke up early so we could start lining up by 9:30AM. Keep in mind that Little Miss doesn't open until 11:00AM. When arriving, they gave us tickets that held out spot in line while we relaxed. \\n\\nThe place was very accommodating, as they were clearly experienced in this. They had ample water coolers around, sunscreen, and a misting system to keep us cool. Before the restaurant opened, a guy came out and hyped up the crowd, which was very fun. \\n\\nWhen we went to order, my friend and I each got the plates, which included 2 sides. He got the pork ribs and I got the brisket (fatty and lean) and split each. The food was amazing; the meats were tender. The ribs fell right off the bone and the brisket was juicy. \\n\\nLittle Miss has a little outside patio with sauces on each table (house, spicy, and sweet and tangy mustard). Seating was more than enough and there was never overcrowding or people waiting for spots. \\n\\nOverall, Little Miss BBQ is our little Valhalla in the desert.\",\n",

It\\'s hard to see in the picture but I\\'m not a heavy eater, but rubios please put beans in a bean burrito!!

I just wish this location would work on employee\\'s personalities and assigning someone to get online orders out...this isn\\'t the first time it has happened at this location...it\\'s consistent.

The girl working the front was in training so it was expected to take a little longer, so the wait was ok. There was a lady who was doing the serving for us indoor orders and man was she fast, like a machine. I don't usually do panda for Chinese, maybe once every 6 months but in the area I live in there aren't many spots to choose from. Its a clean spot with friendly employees. I did notice they had a fridge with freshly cut veggies that they use in their dishes and seen them grilling the teriyaki chicken. Being that it's busy you know your food is going to be fresh because nothing sits for too long.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Believe the hype. \\n\\nAfter several awful experiences at Pomegranate, we were happy to see a new breakfast option open. Check out my review of Pomegranate for more details. \\n\\nWe\\'ve been in about 3 times now and loved it all 3 times. There are so few places like this anymore. The amount of pride put into everything they do is so incredible!  So far, I don\\'t think we\\'ve found a single thing that isn\\'t made from scratch. My girlfriend asked for hot sauce. One of the owners kindly obliged. When he got back he brought 2 store bought hot sauces along with a cup of his homemade. He said we could try the store bought \"not so good one\", or try his. He was absolutely right. We used the whole cup. \\n\\nThe pride even goes into the water that is used for coffee. We don\\'t drink soda. We always order water with meal. The same owner said to make sure to use the water on the soda machine because they use a top notch filtration system. \\n\\nThere was a family with a toddler right next to us. At one point, the child had dropped a small toy on the floor. The owner came from behind the counter, actually wiped the toy off with a clean towel, and gave it to the parents. On my first visit, one of the owners took my 11 year old daughter to watch her decorate cookies for an upcoming birthday party. She gave my daughter a sample as well. That\\'s service. \\n\\nThe breakfast and pastries are delicious. I love cannolis and this place has them. Naturally, all aspects of them, including the shells, are made from scratch. \\n\\nSo if you have the option, skip Pomegranate and go here. It\\'s a way better experience all around.',\n",

I can only assume this is for control of their product. 1 butcher 1 side dish server and 1 cashier. This is the reason for the long line. Since there is a limited quantity of each item, they will run out as the line moves along. The first item to go is usually the fatty brisket (get this if it's available). By the time you're close to order you will know exactly what is available to purchase. Once you get to the counter you get a very detailed service which is a good thing. I can only say, this is legit Texas style Smoked BBQ. It's not a national franchise or chain. Every item is deliciously smoked even the desert is smoked. Don't miss out on that pie. If you have about 2hrs to wait for BBQ this is the place to be. Enjoy!\",\n",

We placed our order and then waited for about 20 minutes to get it. We stood in the back of the place waiting and then finally moved outside to watch as the young man made the crepes. As we were sitting I noticed a female employee who was. Asking drinks and delivering orders inside and out of the place, with no hair net or hat to hold her long hair back. She constantly moved her hair back with her hands  and or would touch her face and then go back to what she was doing. Never wore gloves nor washed her hands after touching her face or hair or even when she would go in and out of the front door, grabbing the handle. Occasionally she would wipe her fingers on a white towel but gross. \\n\\nI'm not so sure this is a place I would want to come back to until she reapplies for a food handlers card.\",\n",

I had an oyster craving so we decided to check it out.\\n\\nIt's located in City Scape which is convenient and easy to find compared to other downtown locations. We were able to park in the garage which was a very short walk away. The only downside was that we forgot there was a game that night in downtown... well actually two games. So the parking prices were changed to $20 due to the events.\\n\\nI got a reservation through their website on OpenTable and our table was ready the moment we arrived. There appeared to be about 3-4 groups waiting. The ambiance inside was super charming and I loved looking at how the place was designed. Such fun furniture pieces and lighting. They had several Tv's showing the games but they were not obnoxious or distracting. It blended in nicely.\\n\\nOur server was personable. I got two oysters (I told you I had a little craving for them!) And a half pound of crab legs. I requested them to be steamed. I loved that you could order the oysters by the piece. I'm not sure if it's because I was craving them THAT bad or because they were THAT good but man oh man those were the best oysters I've ever had. I was in heaven. The crab came with cuts so you don't have to try to get the meat yourself. It was a win win for me.\\n\\nThe Arrogant Butcher will definitely be included on my rotation of restaurants. Look to reserve a table online, and keep in mind if it's a game day if you want to avoid paying overpriced parking!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I had a very disappointing experience at The Arrogant Butcher. Having been there before, I chose it as a restaurant to bring some friends from out of town to. This was a party of nine. All women. \\n\\nAt first experience was fine. A little bit slow but definitely not anything I would've complained about. When it came time for the bill, one woman was brought an individual check and everything else was put on one check. We realized there must've been a miscommunication in discussing the bill. I asked the waitress, Monica, if she would please split the check so everybody could have their own bill as we were all separate. She immediately declined and said we should have told her at the beginning that we wanted separate checks. She said that we could do the math for each item we ordered and write our names of the top of the receipt totaling what each of us got to the corresponding debit card name. \\nWhile I did feel like this was a little bit ridiculous, we all complied.\\n\\n One of my friends leaned over to another friend and said that the waitress just being lazy. Those same friends, after doing their math, got up went to the bathroom. The waitress followed them into the bathroom and began to yell and scream at one of them. She then came out and hysterically yelled and screamed at me as well. I kept trying to give her the check that we had taken the time to total out each patron's menu items but she refused to accept it. She said she was transferring us to the bar and wanted nothing more to do with our table. I had to personally flag down the manager even though he was made well aware of the situation. I actually had to flag him down twice before he finally came to talk to our table. Meanwhile, we still had not been given the opportunity to pay our bill. \\n\\nMy friend who was yelled at in the bathroom explained what happened to the manager and he made no apology. He kept saying it was an unfortunate situation and he wished it hadn't happened. He also kept trying to change the subject and asking her how she liked the food. He said he wish there was something he could do to make it better. I kept saying that an apology would make it a lot better but he would not do it. He then left for a few minutes and came back saying he was going to give half off of everyone's bill. I told him that while that was very generous, that was not what we were looking for. It would be very nice if he gave our table an apology. He still kept repeating that it was unfortunate and he wished it hadn't happened. Towards the very end of our confrontation, he said he apologized for the situation. It took us an hour and a half just to pay our check. During that time nobody refilled her waters or did anything even near our table. We were just trapped there and made to feel like we did something wrong. While my one friend admits that she should not have said the waitress was lazy, and she did apologize for that, I feel our table was treated extremely unfairly and rude by your establishment. The fact that the manager had no reaction to a waitress following a customer into the bathroom and screaming at her was shocking and appalling. I love Fox restaurants and I was so disappointed to not only be treated that way, but also to have my out-of-town guests screamed at by a waitress.\",\n",

I think the organizers may have addressed at least some of the issues that were present in previous years. \\n\\nThere were a lot of free samples this year and I didn't feel like the crowds were out of control for the most part. The line was long for a couple of very popular vendors, but most of the vendors I was able to walk right up to or had only a short wait. You still definitely want to get in line early for the very popular food trucks/booths since they will run out of items before the day is over. \\n\\nI think the price of admission should be $15-20 for General Admission instead of $25 or they should include a couple more freebies with General Admission. I noticed a lot of the VIP bags were not even picked up by 4pm. Maybe next year offer free goodie bags to the first 500 people?\\n\\nMy favorite things were the Mustache Mocha from Pour Jo Coffee, the Soybean Bao from Hot Bamboo, the microgreens from YoBro and the cool vegan buttons sold  in the apparel booth. I do agree with other reviewers that the organizers should reach out to Follow Your Heart, Tofurky, etc. to have booths here and offer free samples and coupons. A decent amount of non-vegans also come to these festivals, so it's still worth it for the major vegan brands to be represented here. \\n\\nI also liked the location of the festival and thought it was a good choice. However, the recycling and trash bins were confusing to tell apart, so that is something that can be improved for next year. \\n\\nOverall, a great time though and I'm happy I  came!\",\n",

No, but good and I always look forward to a chance to Chino. Now i have kids I've passed that on to them...they love to Chino as well.  Food has pretty much remained the same over the years which is good. What has changed at least recently is the execution of service.  I live much farther away from Chino than in the old days...20+ miles. So when I bring the family to Chino's or bring carryout home, it is kind of a special occasion. Last time...brought the family plus my mom in, they screwed up our order and were out of Snickerdoodles. Granted, they quickly fixed the order and promised us double snickerdoodles next time. Ok...crap happens.  Let it slide.  Tonight I went in..wrote my take out order (3 rice bowls 2 combos 50-something bucks) mentioned they owed me double cookies and the guy said no problem.  Order came out pretty quickly for a Friday night so I took it and drove the 20+ miles home.  They neatly package takeout orders with the bag folded and tucked so it isn't practical to check your order in the restaurant.  Unfortunately when I got home my son's rice bowl was missing.  Called Chinos to tell them they (again) screwed up my order but this time I'm a half hour away. Again the guy on the phone was cool and said he'd give me two combos for free next time even though it was a rice bowl missing.  I appreciate the attempt at service recovery.  However fact is Chino is in an 0 for 2 slump.  Place is a favorite of mine from the way back. But if service doesn't improve next time....no more Takee  Outee forevermore.  Place will still have patrons lined up to the door so they won't miss me I guess.\",\n",

Now living out of state, I ordered a birthday cake for both of my grandchildren that were turning one year old. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! Not only did it look like a 5-year-old had made it, but the cake was pretty much inedible. Bits of salt and/or baking soda not mixed into the batter properly and basically just horrible. My daughter-in-law tried to fix it up to look more presentable, but unfortunately, that did not fix the cake itself. \\nI emailed the bakery and received a reply about how the decorator looks at the written notes, and then determines how to decorate. She went on and on about that, as if perhaps it was MY FAULT  for not communicating exactly what I wanted. There was no explanation as to why the cake the was so bad, but of course you CANNOT DEFEND POOR QUALITY.  The owner also stated that of the 60 customers they serve every weekend, only one is dissatisfied. I think not. Read the rest of the reviews. For almost $60 bucks, I could have easily ordered a grocery store cake for much less money, that at least tasted and looked better. These people are SUPPOSED TO BE PROFESSIONALS!  I think not! And for all of the \"nice girls\" at the front and answering the phones, I would advise you to seek out other employment. Your sweet demeanor is not going to save this place. Reputation is everything, and this company\\'s reputation is quickly being flushed down the toilet. Maybe they shouldn\\'t have let all of the previous employees go, at least they knew what they were doing!!!',\n",

Both were cooked very well. The salsa bar was very limited not sure if it was due to them just opening when I got here. \\nI also tried a gordita which was not impressive. It was more like an arepa but it had a lot of flour in the masa which made it gummy. \\nI will stick to the asada, calabacita, tripa, and lengua tacos!',\n",

       "  'text': \"This is a small little Mexican food stop within the Scottsdale 101 complex that left me with mixed feelings.  I happened by this place on a weeknight at the invitation of one of my friends.  They offer tacos, burritos, and assorted other Mexican staples.\\n\\nThe service was quick and we were given our food shortly after ordering.  I ordered a taco meal combo and a burrito.  First issue was they got my order wrong on the burrito, giving me steak instead of the chicken I asked for.  Not a huge deal, but given that we were almost the only customers there, it was disappointing.  The taco meal was the best part of the experience.  They have a little buffet bar to add on additional salsa, cilantro, and other vegetables, which I took advantage of.  All in all it was tasty, however, the guacamole looked like it was made in a blender on liquify, and reminded me of the green slime I would see on Nickelodeon as a kid.  Not my favorite.  The rice and refried beans that accompanied the taco were pretty good though!\\n\\nThe burrito was more disheartening.  I'm not a big fan of steak in Mexican food.  I find it usually contains an inordinate amount of fat/gristle and this was no exception.  In addition it just did not taste that great and lacked flavor.  I would sooner pick up a burrito from Chipotle in the future.\\n\\nOutside of the food, the restaurant itself is fine.  It was clean, however, it was pretty dead after 6:30.  We were the only ones there chatting for probably another hour after that.  Not a terrible experience, but I probably won't be back anytime soon.\",\n",

However it's my understanding new owners took over recently, and since then the food has been very disappointing. The chicken wings seem like lower quality meat (and in a full order I only got one paddle piece and the rest were drumettes full of gristle). The sweet potato fries that were once big and crispy came as a big soggy lump soaked in grease. Ordered a brunch item this morning that was supposed to have shredded chicken but there was no chicken and just a big plate of soggy nacho chips drenched in some kind of brown sauce. First time I've had to send back food here. Thankfully our waitress was very apologetic and took it off the check. It's sad because I would've rated this place 4 stars or higher before the new owners took over. Hope they take a hard look at their food quality and the folks they have cooking it.

It was good, but not worth the $13.00 I paid for it.  It should have been an appetizer not a lunch.  I was so hungry that on the way home, I picked up something else to eat.\",\n",

Definitely the kind of family-owned restaurant that makes you want to root for their success. \\n\\nI had the Bubba Grubba breakfast which included a half order of biscuits and gravy, two eggs over medium, homemade sausage and a delicious slice of thick cut bacon. I also opted for a side of fruit - it was perfectly ripe and delicious. The drip coffee was pretty standard but no complaints! \\n\\nTheir menu contains a nice selection to choose from but not too big. I had a hard time deciding what to get because several options caught my\\nEye. I'll definitely be back. \\n\\nWhat do I think makes this place extra special though? The staff. They clearly know each other really well - in a good way - and communicate like a family. That connection and their love translates into their service. I got the sense that I was at my grandma or aunties house for Sunday breakfast and that's a rare vibe to catch these days. \\n\\nEvery neighborhood needs a great diner with great comfort food. And this place fits the bill. Do yourself a favor and give 'em a go.\",\n",

We arrived ten minutes before 11 and found out that all the newbies have the same strategy. Although it was hot, the staff does an excellent job at making you feel comfortable. There were water stations throughout the line to keep you adequately hydrated with the majority of the line in covered shade with misting machines to keep you nice and cool. The staff also provides foldable chairs and sunscreen.\\n\\n   While waiting in line, a staff member rounded a few times to provide samples as well as updates to those waiting on what menu items were still available. We reached the counter a little past 1 o'clock and had all menu options still available. We elected to order the two meat platter with brisket and pulled pork which comes with two sides in which we chose the jalapeño grits and ranch style beans. We also added a jalapeño stuffed sausage and a cup of potato salad. This was a perfect sampler for two people.\\n\\n   What you've all been waiting for... does the food live up to the hype? The brisket literally falls apart and melts in your mouth. The jalapeño sausage has just enough kick. Jalapeño cheese grits are a must. Potato salad has a great bit of dill and not to mayonnaisey. The beans have good chunks of pulled pork in them but were just okay to me. \\n\\n   And now the sauces. I judge most BBQ joints on whether the meat actually needs sauce. LMB does not; however, the sauces were a nice compliment to the meat. Table favorite was the spicy sauce which paired perfectly with the pork and brisket. Next in line was the mustard based sauce, which we didn't like individually but tasted great on the pork. Rounding out the three is the house sauce, which is a sweeter tomato based sauce. \\n\\n   If I could make a suggestion to those visiting Little Miss BBQ for the first time, arrive early as the initial wait will be much cooler and will result in less total waiting time than arriving minutes before opening. You will not find a friendlier staff truly blown away by the customer service provided.\",\n",

The rice and beans are in line with what I expect when ordering Mexican food. Not especially fantastic, but not bad at all!\\n\\nThe salsa bar is a highlight, with both green and red traditional salsa, which are both delicious (and pack some heat!), pico de gallo, cilantro, limes, onions, etc.\\n\\nI had the burrito with mixed meat (chicken and steak) both trips, and I will say I preferred it the second time, without the pickled onions, but that is completely personal preference. My wife got the protein bowl, which came in a large portion, and was as tasty as it looked (according to her). We got the quesadilla for our daughter, and I got her leftovers (as usual). That's gotta be the best quesadilla leftovers I've had since we moved to Phoenix two years ago. \\n\\nBeing from San Diego, finding a top notch Mexican place was priority one, and after almost two years, we finally struck gold.\\n\\nWay to go, Mr. Mesquite! You won us over!\",\n",

This happened to be one of the experiences I would say wasn't bad but definitely a memorable one. Google maps suggested this as an Indian buffet... so I thought why not. Upon arriving we were greeted with a not so genuine hello accompanied with a not so genuine smile. The food was good but not worth visiting again since the service was not on par. As I am writing this wonderful review I and my lovely fiancé are still waiting for our naan bread. It is now going on 10 mins... in conclusion good food... not good atmosphere or vibes.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"So...it has been three years since I have eaten here. I have heard all the hype about how great this restaurant is since my last visit. We went with friends and found the dining room is inviting. When you walk into the back dining area it feels like you are in someone\\ns dining room. It is very inviting. The Caprese salad was delicious. The tomatoes actually tasted like tomatoes back east. The mozzarella had a lot of flavor. We were told they make their own. My friend ordered the chicken dish with fingerling potatoes. She said it had good flavor but there was very little chicken, mostly potatoes. The Pasta wth meat and bolognese sauce had good flavor but was a small amount of pasta. I ordered the Wise Guy pizza with sausage and cheese but was told by the waiter that there was no marinara sauce on it? HUH? So he recommended the margarita pizza and add sausage for an extra charge. The pizza had very little sausage and maybe a few tablespoons of cheese. The crust was overcooked on the edges but the center was soggy. \\n\\nThe prices are HIGH . Really,  one pizza for $25? I thought all the prices were high. The service last time was good. this time, fair, saw the waiter once. My drink was never refilled and no one ever checked on us. \\n\\nThis is strictly my opinion and I know many people love this place but frankly this place needs some work. As I previously stated, The Parlor right across the street is so much better. Obviously Phoenicians like to pay BIG prices for dough with sauce and little else. I won't be back.\",\n",

Here's what I know you'll like if you're a steak lover....just the right char on the outside (slightly smoky, a touch crisp), divinely seasoned, internal medium rare perfection, excellent grill lines and a whole lot of self-congratulations for picking something that literally changed my mood.  The potato on the side was tasty and sized right; the crispy veg added a hint of sweet.\\n\\nWhat else did we try?  Well, the pics aren't great due to dim lighting and my family yelling that they were starving and to stop taking pictures---lol--but - we also got a ton of appetizers.  The pretzel fondue was salty, filling and warm cheese makes for a good day.  The Crispy shrimp won the day with a light batter and dipping sauce.  And, we should have ordered more Prosciutto Deviled Eggs.  We didn't try the Buffalo Chicken Thighs, but our neighbors did and loved them - seemed easy to eat with a fork.  Raw Oysters were very fresh, came with traditional accompaniments.  Make a reservation.\\n\\nFor dinner, it was the amazing Filet, salmon, sort rib stew, and Mac-n-Cheese.  With the two salmon dinners, one had modified sides.  Both orders were good and they seemed to really like the flavor, but both family members were still hungry afterwards.  \\n\\nDessert: the Hot Chocolate Cake was teeny but cute and still shareable.  The Peanut Butter Cup: super rich.  I like peanut butter but had not anticipated a cup of heated peanut butter with a scoop of chocolate ice cream in the middle.  Cool concept, we didn't each much, though.  \\n\\nImportant point I might have mentioned once or twice :) - make a reservation before you go - the wait time can be 2 hours if you don't.  If that's ok with you or even if it's not, then belly up to the bar and enjoy their wide selection of liquor choices.  The Polish Fix turned out great both times it arrived at my table.

It was worth every minute of the excruciating wait after getting in line well before 15 minutes of opening time.

I sent my food back and was waiting a good 15 minutes for a properly cooked burger to arrive back at our table, by then my wife had finished and my hunger had surpassed, I asked my waiter to box it up for me to take with me.\\nI was given this part of the meal for free by the concerned manager, he was apologetic and seemed disappointed.\\nI think it was a one off Bad burger experience and I was the unlucky person that day. I ate the burger at home shortly after, it was now over cooked, I wasn't surprised maybe that was karma for the complaint. \\nI haven't been back as yet, but never say never.\",\n",

It was good that they had real pieces of lemongrass and galangal in it. Although they could have taken them out after cooking the dish so that diners didn't end up with a hard piece of lemongrass or galangal in their mouth when eating. The pad thai consisted of smaller rice noodles than I usually see in the dish. There was no lime slice, but it had peanut pieces. The pad thai dish was the type that had the orange pad thai sauce instead of the brown one that I sometimes see in pad thai dishes. The chicken wasn't dry either. I also checked into the restaurant and received a free thai ice tea. Overall the food was tasty but nothing extraordinary.\",\n",

We were not looking for anything in particular.  So I used Yelp to look for a place near her when I stumbled up on this little gem!  She said she had just heard that the place was one of the best in the whole U.S. and they did not disappoint.  We purchased a meal and some meat by the pound (pulled pork and ribs -ribs are only sold by the pound). I regret being there late that day (we got there at around 2 pm, I believe) because they were out of a lot of meats.  The service was super friendly and prompt!  The place is very unassuming, but don't let that full you.  It is worth the price, the trip, and the wait (yes, there is usually a line out the door).

She  forgot to bring a rag and ended up putting all our napkins  on the spill, and made it seem  like such a problem for her to get more napkins. Would speak to the floor manager but she was on her cell not working. our waitress name tag said Cass. the only employee actually working on the floor was a man named Terry, whom we wish we would get as a server more often. Hope this helps everyone. Also hope someone in the management reads this and gets a clue.\",\n",

Now I'm not usually the kind of person who likes to wait in a line but I thought ok I have some down time. \\n\\nI arrive at this place and sure enough there was a line. But here is the thing about the line. Every 10 min or so someone comes out to check on the people standing there. To let them know what items have either sold out or about to. There is water and even sunscreen provided!  It's pretty awesome customer service. The dad of the owner even came by to tell me all about their food and what would be good for a first timer like me. \\n\\nI pretty much got a little of everything. And yes!!!!! It was fabulous! The ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and sausage seriously mouth watering! \\n\\nBut really what makes it take a little piece of my heart is their genuine customer service. I love how everyone there seemed to care about the customers and looked after each and every them.  \\n\\nIf you like some fantastic BBQ go here.

       "  'text': \"I don't typically write reviews, especially bad ones, but my experience yesterday at BW3's was frustrating.  I'll say first, I'm a bit more of a vegetable lover but went to this restaurant last night at my son's request for his 17th birthday.  My daughter has a gluten intolerance, so it was frustrating to see that there was nothing diet friendly for her.  But we made the best of it due to the birthday.  I ordered a side salad as my meal.  What I received was one of the most spoiled gross plates of, what used to be food, in front of me.   I felt like Gordon Ramsey picking through my dish.  Most of the lettuce was brown and wilting.  Buried under that, was a wad of dark brown mush approximately 2 inches in diameter.  I thought at first it may be a mushroom, but no... it was (or used to be) lettuce.  More appropriately you could call it compost.  I showed my server my discovery.  He apologized profusely and took the salad back and brought me a new one.  This one was fine.  Missing some of the ingredients that are supposed to come on it, most notably the Parmesan cheese.  But at that point it didn't really matter.  I didn't have trust in the BOH/kitchen and was too grossed out to eat anything more.  My daughter also had a side salad.  I started inspecting her food after sending mine back.  Her lettuce was in the same dismal shape, minus the wad of rotted food.  I can only imagine how many days ago those salads were prepped and sat. 5? 10 maybe?  I sent her salad back too.  I was told a manager would be stopping by.  He never did.  Salads were also not comped from the receipt.  I chose not to complain because my son was already feeling bad about not choosing a restaurant everyone would enjoy.  I assured him it wasn't his fault but there was definitely a deflated feeling to the meal.  I worked for over 10 years in the food industry doing every job from server/dishwasher/expo/hostess/wait staff/to event planning.  I know what goes into a kitchen.  I have grave hesitations about eating the food here based off what I saw last night.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'When this place opened two years ago I liked it and it became a Happy Hour or \"grab a few drinks with the guys\" staple.  They had slightly better than average bar food and an excellent selection of spirits, beer too.  The wait staff was a little hit and miss and some of the employees exhibited some questionable behavior.  They also had a good crowd on Friday evenings, as we had to wait a couple of times for a seat.  \\n\\nFast forward a year from the opening.  They tired to reinvent the place to a degree, which I\\'m cool with.  They sized down their menu and got rid of almost all of their higher-end spirits.  That\\'s fine if you exchange the quantity of your selections with higher quality food.  I would argue that with the change, both the quantity of selection and quality of food went down a notch.  \\n\\nThen over the next few months so did the quality of the wait staff and the care put into the overall establishment.  We had a couple of experiences where the attitude of the server was borderline \"why are you bothering me\".  One time, after trying to grab the attention of a few of the wait staff to grab our drinks that had been sitting at the station on the end of the bar, I finally walked up and grabbed them myself.  This happens from time to time at places, but seems to be the rule and not the exception when I have been in.\\n\\nLast time I was in I noted that they had redone their TV system.  I\\'ve attached a picture.  This jumble of wires sits in the middle of the place with no attempt made to conceal it from the patrons.  If this little care is put into the public areas of the business, image what the status of the kitchen is.',\n",

The time lost by the employee running back-and-forth to try to deliver orders by asking each single car what they had would be so much more efficient if they delivered the food at the drive-through window like most other fast food restaurants do',\n",

There was an older man wasted @ the bar who was going on re how he\\'d been there drinking nonstop since 1030am ( it was now 6ish). He was yelling all kinds of profanities & talking about getting weed & getting high then says that he needs his keys so he can drive home.

Fd comes & after they left, Mike came over completely cleared my table & gave me my check!!! I said is there a problem? He said, you need to go, I need that table..... now mind you in my 45+ years, I\\'ve NEVER had that happen!!! I said I didn\\'t realize I was done. Then he says, you can sit w them ( referring to the couple in the booth next to mine WHO I DID NOT KNOW!!!) The whole thing was so bizarre!!!

It sounded so strange, but everything looked so good. Optimize your stop here and get the bowl with 2 items. You can leave the meat in the bowl as is or put it in one of their other options (quesadilla or burrito). My choice was the Chinese BBQ Pork (my favorite of the 2 items, which I left as just the meat) and the Hengrenade Chicken (because it is milder than the Jerk Chicken option) in a quesadilla. Everything came out hot and fresh, the meat was tender and flavorful. And the Snickerdoodle Cookies. AH THE COOKIES. You must get a cookie. Do it.

First, I tried the chorizo tacos which were hands down extremely comparable to the real thing. I didn't even think twice about having real eggs or beef chorizo. You can tell the cooks take great care to pay attention to details. The grilled corn tortillas added an extra touch. Next up I decided to give a burger a try. The garbanzo, red potato burger will not disappoint you as it provides a well melded combination of perfectly seasoned ingredients that will keep you from ever missing an all beef patty. The dish is served with your choice of French fries or a salad and not just your run of the mills salads an arugula based salad with cherry tomatoes and a balsamic dressing. Each dish I ordered shows the great care taken to provide not only we'll prepared food but, an artistic flare to simple yet wholesome bites that will keep me coming back for more.\",\n",

I didn't have my phone on me either so I had no idea what I was in for. \\n\\nWe came for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. There seemed to be a lot of people waiting but the hostess said the wait was only 15 minutes so we decided it should be worth it. The wait time was accurate and they had plenty of space to wait around at outside and inside. Inside there was complimentary coffee and water along with newspapers and menus which made the 15 minutes feel like 5. The couches were super comfy too so that probably helped!\\n\\nThe place itself was darling. It had a very charming ambiance that was fluid throughout. I got a superfood a.m. bowl that consisted of a chia seed pudding topped with tons of fruits and a side of peanut butter toast. I've never had chia seed pudding and was worried I wouldn't like, but it was AHHmazing. \\n\\nI will *totally* be back, and soon!\",\n",

My friends and I are regulars at Blue Agave, coming in almost every night after work for a drink and occasional beer pong. We\\'re always respectful and have never had a problem. Tonight an employee, Eddie, asked if he could play next, and we agreed. Then before we had a chance to finish the game we were still in, he states we have two minutes to finish, and when we asked why he said he can do whatever he wants \"because he works there.\" This man then becomes very hostile, getting in my friends face and actually FLIPPING the beer pong table over. He proceeds to yell and scream at my friends for the next twenty minutes, and everyone at the bar (even the people not involved) left because of it.

The guy at the door had an attitude from the start. The buffet consisted of bland tasting food and fruit that wasn't fully ripe. The chicken at the buffet was mushy.....how do you get mushy chicken? We paid for a table for 4. When it was time to bring out the champagne, the staff tried to only give us 1 bottle, instead of the 2 we paid for. When we asked for the 2nd bottle, they brought out a bottle of Andre's. Really? I could have spend the $10 at the store and bought that myself. The couple at the next table complained about the service as well - they were only brought 1 bottle and paid for 2. This was no where near worth the $170 that we paid and will never come back. The only good thing about the place....the upper level bartenders were polite and had good customer service.\",\n",

It was a bit breezy and sunny, maybe some sun shades would help with this, but I also didnt notice whether they had them or not. Our waiter was awesome, efficient and knowledgable.

Every time I patron Arrogant Butcher I order something different and I am never disappointed.\\n\\nWe also had a dozen oysters, I love the price point on these as well.  The only complaint this time around was that I had A LOT of shell to spit out with each one.  That is the only reason for 4 stars.

I let them pick from the pastry display while I had the egg boat. They chose croissants, which were dry like they were old.  My egg boat,  on the other hand,  was under done.   When I ordered it, the gentleman that took my order seemed like he didn't know what I was asking for even though the item is on the menu on the back wall. The bread under baked, and the egg was overcooked. The yolk was cooked all the way through. It is disappointing since this is not a cheap joint considering the small portions. My coffee tasted stale and I heard another patron saying the same.  Won't be back.\",\n",

They serve up some modern American meals with a hint of some cultural punch like the Banh Mi, Poke Bowls, and Chile Rellanos.  Their drink selections are fun and extensive so take your time.  I'm a whiskey guy and the manager was willing to offer his suggestions and boy did he hit the spot for me!  I love it spicy and he did me well.  \\n\\nMoving on to the food since this is a food review, we started out with some brussel sprouts and steam clams.  The brussel sprouts were slightly roasted and came along with some andouille sausage.  Our steam clams came on a sweet and savory white wine tomato sauce.  It was so good I asked for another round of flatbread to soak up the sauce!  Sweet and full of chunks of tomato; it was savory with every bite! \\n\\nFor my entree, I shot for the Fire Braised Short Ribs while my friend got their barramundi.  She said it was well cooked and had a nice crispy skin.  My short ribs were on fire; but not what you think.  It's not spicy by any means, but man it was tender to the point where I didn't need a knife to cut through it.  The farro risotto added a sweet creamy texture along with the vegetables which was cooked to perfection; not raw, but still had a fresh crisp crunch.   \\n\\nOverall, our service was phenomenal and attentive.  The ambiance is fresh and cool; definitely need to come back for just drinks and HH.  Finally, the food was popping especially to my palates!  Enjoy!\",\n",

Ha ha My group thought it was hilarious! We had a 15 min wait and were offered ice water while we wait and they also had misters which was nice. He explained the menu and offered options for sides ( so this bouncer knew his info ) we worked our way through the line and everything was fabulous! Sat down and quickly received our food which was amazing ! Kids meals were a good size and I ordered the southwestern breakfast burrito  it was filled with , chorizo eggs and cream cheese topped that with a side of salsa ! My son ordered biscuits and gravy which I\\'m sure were made from scratch just like the other muffins that they had! Definitely a must go to spot !

Not as sweet as I have read on some reviews here but I did have someone in my party agree with that. The rice was super soft which was good enough for me. The quality of the fish which is most important to me was so surprisingly good and one of the best I have tried in Pheonix. I actually liked the fish in the rolls a lot. As for the nigiri, I'd say the quality of the fish was not quite there, with the exception of the scallops being really fresh and sweet. It can get crowded. It was a 45 min wait when we arrived so we opted for the take out instead which was pretty fast. The guy at the counter could use a little bit more emotion and be friendly though. Still a fun concept and I would definitely be back. Oh and keep in mind it is downtown, so parking can be tough.\",\n",

They brought out the sweet & sour pork on time and then it was about 10 minutes before the next item was brought out, broccoli beef. We had eaten about half of the sweet & sour pork by the time the broccoli beef arrived. We started eating the beef and finishing the sweet & sour. I had to flag someone down to ask where the rest of our meal was (fried rice and lo mein) to which she ran back and grabbed the fried rice.\\n\\nAbout 15 minutes later we still had not received the lo mein so I waved to our waitress and from across the room she yell \"oh yeah, the noodles\" and then went back to clearing tables and didn\\'t go check on the lo mein.

This place is really tucked away but even though the parking isn\\'t great when you get in there the patio music and black and white old tv/shows playing were delightful. I had 2 orders of the zucchini sticks because they where that good aswell the house made ranch dressing was great, not that horrible vinegar after taste you usually get. Wow! We were so full after that but had already ordered dinner. My 14 year old son got the stuffed pizza with REAL cheese from Wisconsin (funny because the take home box said exactly that it was real cheese and not the fake stuff, lmfao). I have never seen soooooo much oooey goooooey and REAL CHEESE on a pizza before. Figure a thin crust, red sauce then 2 inches of REAL mozzarella cheese, your topping and more cheese then red sauce (delicious). More cheese than I have ever seen on a pizza. One of the friendly staff said please let me help you with serving the first slice, because the cheese never stopped it was stretched 5 feet up and still a long stretch of cheese WOW WOW WOW!!!! I LOVED it sooo much and my son even more.  Okay so my boy is eating his main meal and me and mom got a diablo shrimp and a lady scampi shrimp. Wow  both were so tasty. A bit spicy on the scampi and even a heck of a lot more on the Diablo (this was very creamy like Alfredo sauce but kicking it up several notches). Biggest shrimps I have seen on a $15.99 menu. 6 large shrimp (half a pound at least) in your pasta with special sauce and an 8\" slice of French bread drenched in garlic, butter and parsley. Also they will bring you fresh shredded Parmesan cheese. So we have a full menu of spicy delicious Italian food, with plenty of cheese, oh and best pizza we have had in a very long time. I don\\'t want it from anywhere else right now, btw I ate 2 shrimp and maybe an each on each side of this bread. This was the lady scampi. Please go and enjoy great food.',\n",

As a solo diner, they first sent me to the bar.  However there were no seats.  Then they coldly said nothing was available for an hour.  So I left.  But I was able to book a reservation using open table for 15 minutes from then.  They were even MORE rude when I returned.  Management needs to address their attitude.

When I order, I always explain to the person taking my order that I HAVE HAD Nékter many times before but if it isn't an issue for them, I need their gloves changed, clean utensils and blenders used, and no banana, gluten, etc. I tell them if they are not comfortable doing this or need clarification they can ask me and I always thank them heavily because I know this is a lot to ask. However out of all the times I have tried the Tatum location there have only been TWO times they followed through with what I asked and I had to give my juice/bowl to someone else. \\n\\nBeside this issue, the slow pace of this juice bar makes it impossible to get a quick pick up from this location without having to order 30-40 mins ahead on the app and with that you risk having a soggy bowl or separated juice. \\n\\nAdditionally many times my friends and I have had to clean the table we are sitting at because it was sticky or there was spilled juice or toppings on the surface.\\n\\nDespise these issues, the location is modern and has very natural, nice lighting.

Didn't think it would be that difficult to add some sundried tomatoes to some noddles. Well yes no sundried tomatoes.  Than as me and friends are finishing up dinner a waiter accidentally dropped glasses of water on my back. He apologized which I understand accidents happen. But what shocked me was 1) the manager didn't even bother to come out to apologize and if manager wasn't there than the next person in charge should have also come out to apologize. But to my surprise he/she didn't. What a coward. 2) not even some type of discount was given.  Not that I needed it but being offered what would have been a nice gesture after they gave me a shower.  So for that they get 1/2 a star.\",\n",

PBR holds a special place in my heart, from my college days and I don't care if you make fun of me, I actually like the way it tastes. You can get a tall boy for like 2 dollars at Harvey's. \\n\\nI also really enjoy the food, they have weekly burger deals-which are worth it. I've had the classic wine burger-with cheese, the patty melt, and the chicken one. Don't get the chicken one, it isn't very good. I think it's just on the menu to have that option, but it tastes bland and like it came from frozen. \\n\\nThe good news is, the other burgers are pretty spot on. I love the patty melt, it's open goey glory. The wine burger is flavourful and moist. The fries are pretty good too. I will say, there has been some inconsistency, it depends who is cooking. The guy with the beard does a great job. For the price though, and the excellent divey atmosphere, this place is great.\",\n",
